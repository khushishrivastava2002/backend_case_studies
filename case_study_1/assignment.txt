CASE STUDY 1
Traffic Event & Analytics Service
Western Express Highway (Andheri → Bandra)
You will build a Python backend service that ingests traffic signals and converts them into
meaningful events and analytics.

Scope
Analyze traffic conditions for:
●​ Road: Western Express Highway​
●​ Stretch: Andheri → Bandra (Mumbai)​
●​ Time window: A single calendar day of your choice​

The road/location details must be configurable (not hard-coded in business logic).

Data Source
Use HERE Traffic APIs:
https://www.here.com/docs/category/maps-traffic
●​ Traffic Flow (required) – for speeds and congestion​
●​ Traffic Incidents (optional / bonus) – for accidents​

You are expected to:
●​ Read the API documentation​
●​ Handle authentication​
●​ Make periodic API calls​
●​ Parse and store responses​

What You Need to Build
1.​ Data Ingestion
●​ Periodically fetch traffic flow data (e.g., every 5–10 minutes)​
●​ Extract and store at least:​
○​ timestamp​
○​ average speed​
○​ free-flow speed (or equivalent baseline)​

Ingestion may be:
●​ a scheduled job, or​
●​ a manually triggered API endpoint​

2.​ Event Detection (Core Requirement)
Implement stateful congestion detection.
Define your own logic for detecting the following states:
●​ Congestion Started​
​
●​ Congestion Cleared​

Events must:

●​ Be stateful (no repeated alerts every poll)​
●​ Have a lifecycle:​
○​ start time​
○​ end time​
○​ status (ACTIVE, RESOLVED)​

3.​ Analytics
Display analytics for the selected day, such as:
●​ Hourly average speed​
●​ Total number of congestion events​
●​ Total congestion duration (in minutes)​

4.​ Alert / Notification APIs
Expose APIs to retrieve:
●​ Active alerts​
●​ Alert history​

Alerts should include:
●​ type (e.g., CONGESTION)​
●​ start time​
●​ current status​

No push notifications, WebSockets, or UI are required.

Minimum API Endpoints
Your service should expose functionality equivalent to:
POST /ingest/run
GET

/analytics/hourly-speeds

GET

/alerts/active

GET

/alerts/history

Technical Guidelines
●​ Language: Python​
●​ Framework: Flask / FastAPI / Django (your choice)​
●​ Database: Your choice (MySQL, SQLite or MongoDB(preferred))​
●​ Clean project structure and modular code​
●​ Configuration via environment variables or config files​
●​ Meaningful logging and error handling

Optional / Bonus
●​ Traffic incident ingestion (accidents)​
●​ Multiple alert types (slow traffic vs heavy congestion)

CASE STUDY 2
Vehicle Counting from a Live Traffic Camera
This assignment evaluates how you explore CV libraries, reason about noisy data, and build a
basic but robust pipeline.

Problem Statement
You will be provided with a live YouTube traffic camera stream covering a road intersection.
Your task is to:
●​ Capture frames from the live stream​
●​ Detect vehicles​
●​ Count vehicles moving in each direction​
●​ Report counts for a fixed duration

Input
●​ A live YouTube traffic camera URL
○​ https://www.youtube.com/live/B0YjuKbVZ5w?si=Pgn-xB8PE9v_p9RO​
●​ Assume a fixed, static camera​

You may:
●​ Process a fixed duration (e.g., 3–5 minutes)​
●​ Sample frames at a reasonable rate (e.g., 1–2 FPS)

Output
At the end of the run, output:
Duration processed: 5 minutes
Direction A: 124 vehicles

Direction B: 97 vehicles
Total vehicles: 221

Direction naming is up to you (e.g., Left/Right, North/South).
Add clip of the partition fo the video processed in your submission from the overall video

Technical Requirements
●​ Language: Python​
●​ You may use:​
○​ OpenCV​
○​ Pretrained YOLO (Ultralytics, etc.)​
○​ Any equivalent CV library​
●​ No model training required​
●​ Basic tracking is optional

Deliverables (Both Case Studies)
Please submit:
1.​ Send code in Zip file
○​ If possible host the code on public URL and share link for demo evaluation

2.​ A Git repository​

3.​ A README that includes:​

○​ Setup instructions​
○​ How to run each case study​
○​ Key assumptions​
○​ Known limitations​
○​ What you would improve with more time
3. For case study 2 show output video with logical overlays and bounding boxes​

Optional:
●​ Screenshots or short video snippets​
●​ Logs or sample outputs​

Final Note
There is no single “correct” solution — we are interested in:
●​ How you think​
●​ How you structure problems​
●​ How you deal with ambiguity​

We look forward to discussing your approach and decisions with you.
